        <h3>What is Voltage, Current, and Resistance?</h3>

		<p>Electricity in a circuit involves charge-carrying electrons moving along a wire, and can be understood the same way as water flowing through a hose. Voltage is similar to water pressure, Current is similar to the flow of water, and resistance is the thickness of the hose. To help understand this, imagine a gardener with a hose and no water flowing through it. As he turns the faucet the water pressure increases, and as the pressure increases, the water flows faster. Also note that the thickness of the hose remains the same throughout. Now imagine the gardener watering a garden, with the hose on full blast. The pressure of the water is high, and the water is flowing very fast. Now by accident, the gardener steps on the hose, making it half as thick at one point. Naturally the water flows much slower, but the water pressure from the faucet is still full blast. A circuit works just like this scenario. If the Resistance of a circuit (or thickness of a hose) remains unchanged as the Voltage (water pressure) is increased, the Current (flow) will increase. But if the Resistance decreases but Voltage remains the same, the Current will decrease. This relationship between Voltage, Resistance and Current is described by Ohm’s Law: (Voltage) = (Current )* (Resistance), or V=IR. All circuits are described with these properties. </p>

        <h3>Elements of a circuit</h3>
		
        <p>A basic circuit looks like this:</p>
		
        <p>(insert fig 1)</p>
		
        <p>This circuit is composed of a battery and a resistor. The battery, or Power supply, generates 10 Volts. This 10 Volts pushes the current out of the top 	of the Power supply, through the 5Ω (Ohm) resister, and finally into the bottom of the Power supply. The arrow with the 2A (Amps) represents the current flowing through this simple circuit.</p>

		<h3>Series Resistors</h3>
	
    	<p>Two resisters are said to be in Series when there are two resisters one after another, like in this picture:</p>
	
    	<p>(fig 2)</p>
	
    	<p>Series resisters can be understood using our gardener analogy. Imagine after the gardener had stepped on his hose and decreased the water flow, he spins around in surprise and steps on the hose with his other foot as well. Naturally, the water flow will decrease even further. Now compare the first circuit with the second one. Notice the first circuit with the 5Ω resister had 2A flowing through it, but when the second 5Ω is added the current was cut in half. Thus two resistors in a circuit can be added together and be treated as one resistor. We can redraw the previous circuit to look like this:</p>
	
    	<p>(fig 3)</p>
	
    	<p>This process of combining resistors is called adding in series.</p>

    	<h3>Parallel Resistors</h3>

		<p>A circuit with parallel resistors looks like this:</p>

		<p>(fig 4)</p>

		<p>Parallel Resistors can be understood with the gardener analogy as well. It turns out our gardener has an idea. He believes that it would be easier to water the garden if he can split the hose into two heads, and hold one in each hand. He accomplishes this by attaching a Y shaped nozzle to the hose and attaching a hose to each end. To his dismay, the total water flow in each hose is half the total flow, even though the original faucet is full blast. This effect can be seen in our previous circuit: 10A goes into the split, 5A flows through each branch, and then 10A again after they recombine. Resistors in parallel can be combined just like Resistors in series can, but with this formula:</p>

		<p>(fig 5)</p>

		<p>The resistors from the previous circuit can be combined to look like this:</p>

		<p>(fig 6)</p>

		<p>Notice that Resistors in series combine for a greater total resistance, but parallel resisters combine for less. It is also important to understand what happens when parallel resisters are different values. For example, if we had this circuit:</p>

		<p>(fig 7)</p>

		<p>Notice the Resistor on the right is twice the Resistance as the one on the left, and gets half the current. This would be analogous to the gardener attaching a thicker hose and a thinner hose to the Y nozzle in the previous example. More water would flow through the thicker hose since it is easier to flow into. A thinner hose is analogous to a greater resistance since a thinner hose makes water harder to flow through, just as it is harder for electrons to flow through a higher resistance. One important principle with resistive circuits is that electrons will always flow through the path of least resistance. </p>
